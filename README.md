## Project: DATA630011

*For details, please see DATA MINING CUP 2017*

### Scenario

Real-time automated price generation moves into focus for online retailers. Every day, category management faces the challenge of adapting thousands of products to changing market factors. This happens completely automatically when using an intelligent pricing tool. Prices reflect customer appreciation and lead to increased sales.

The topic of this year’s DATA MINING CUP is to come up with a sales forecast for a mail-order pharmacy that dynamically adapts its prices.

### Task

The central topic of this year’s task at the DATA-MINING-CUP is the development of a model that predicts the revenue of a mail-order pharmacy as accurately as possible. Historical anonymised transaction data of a real mail-order pharmacy are provided. The special feature: Product prices were dynamically generated automatically.
